//This code snippet is defining an event bus using Vue.js, a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.

import Vue from 'vue'
//This line imports the Vue.js library. It assumes that you have Vue.js installed as a dependency in your project.

export const EventBus = new Vue()
//This line creates an event bus instance named EventBus using Vue.
//An event bus is a centralized communication system that allows different components in a Vue.js application 
//to communicate with each other without the need for direct parent-child relationships.

//By using export, the EventBus instance is made available for use in other parts of the application. 
//Other Vue components can import and use this EventBus to emit events and listen for events.
//Now, any component in your application can import the EventBus and use it to communicate with other components indirectly.
